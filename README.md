# Customising Bootstrap with Sass Lesson Task

The video lesson converted the home, product and contact pages to Sass. 

For this task, convert those three pages plus the products and about pages.

Consult the [files from the lesson](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/customising-bootstrap-with-sass) if you get stuck.
